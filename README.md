# Personal Website

## Personal Website built in ReactJS

#### Inspired by Brian Design, I followed the tutorial from time to time, mostly for the CSS part because it had some pretty interesting features
#### Like ES6 arrow functions in CSS:
```
color: ${({dark}) => (dark ? "#010606" : "#fff")};
```

## Libraries used:
* react-router-dom
* react-scroll
* react-icons
* styled-components
